# FDA-Food-Recall-Project
Our project focuses on analyzing FDA recall data. We want to find out important information about recalls. We'll look at which states have the most recalls, categorize the main reasons for recalls, and understand why recalls happen.

We'll start by cleaning up the text data and removing unnecessary words. Then, we'll break down the text into smaller parts for analysis. We'll use a special method to understand which words are important in the recalls. Next, we'll group similar recalls together and give them labels to make things easier to understand.

We'll look at all the data but only use the good parts for our analysis. We'll also make sure our graphs and charts are easy to use and understand. Our goal is to tell a clear and simple story with our data.

This project will help us learn more about FDA recalls and share useful information with others.
